# Text-Classification

## Description:

This project provides a user-friendly Streamlit application for text classification using the pre-trained Bert model (bert-base-uncased). Users can input text, and the application will predict its category (sports or technology) based on the model's predictions.

## Features:

  - Leverages the powerful Bert model for accurate text classification.
  - Streamlit integration for a simple and interactive user interface.
  - Clear predictions displayed on the application.

## Install dependencies:
- pip install streamlit transformers torch

## Usage:

- Clone this repository or download the code.
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Run the application:
  - Bash
  - streamlit run text_classification.py
  - Use code with caution.

- A Streamlit app will open in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501/.
- Enter text in the text area and click the "Classify Text" button.
- The predicted category (sports or technology) will be displayed below.
